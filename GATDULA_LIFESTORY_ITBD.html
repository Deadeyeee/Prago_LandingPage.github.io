  <h2><u>College Years</u></h2>

  <blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I went to college, I was super frustrated because my childhood dream is to be a Doctor.<sup>1</sup> I always wanted to be a pediatrician.<sup>2</sup> I reflect and doubt if I can do it.<sup>3</sup> At the end, I decided to take <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>, since I thought I’m good with it also.<sup>4</sup><q style="background-color:#FECEA ;"><b><i>Sometimes you don’t realize your own strength until you come face to face with your greatest weakness.</i></b></q> <cite>-Susan Gale</cite><sup>5</sup> That’s what I realized as I turned to college.<sup>6</sup> One of my greatest weakness is to be alone since I was very dependent to my parents for 18 years.<sup>7</sup> They always make the decisions in my life.<sup>8</sup> I’m always afraid to depend on myself owning to the fact that I was very afraid to disappoint everyone.<sup>9</sup> As time goes by, I realized I needed to be independent, there’s more to life than only depending on others and not doing it by yourself.<sup>10</sup> I decided to move to Manila for college.<sup>11</sup> At first, my parents did not agreed of that decision, but I was very sure I want it even I know it will not be easy.<sup>12</sup> I moved to manila 2 days before first day of class in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> .<sup>13</sup> The time that my father leaves me at my dorm alone, that’s where it sinks in.<sup>14</sup> First 2 months of my stay in Manila was super stressful.<sup>15</sup> I remember crying every night and it did happen one week straight or more I think.<sup>16</sup> I didn't have my mom right by my side anymore and I needed to become more independent on doing things on my own.<sup>17</sup> Adjusting to a new city, community, and school was a challenge because I was used to being in my own province with my old friends, at my old school.<sup>18</sup> I often got homesick and wanted to go home.<sup>19</sup> Also, I was very frustrated because I admit that It was a hard time for me to cope up for our lessons in school special programming.<sup>20</sup> I can see my classmates are all participating and enjoying that subject but me, I was very clueless.<sup>21</sup> It took a while to get adjusted to my new college life, and being away from home but I finally feel comfortable.<sup>22</sup>My college friends made it bearable.<sup>23</sup> For 3 months of crying and feeling left out, I finally feel that genuine happiness again whenever I am with them and I am very happy up until now we are still friends.<sup>24</sup> I don’t know how many breakdowns and failures I had experience in my first year of college but I’m very happy I’ve survived that stage.<sup>25</sup> I’m currently 2<sup >nd</sup> year student now.<sup>26</sup>  Online class made it harder for me because I’m not a fast learner.<sup>27</sup> But I’m still here surviving and trying to make this online class worth it.<sup>28</sup>
